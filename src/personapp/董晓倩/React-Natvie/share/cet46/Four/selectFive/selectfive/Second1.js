As a country consisting of a great diversityof ethnic groups and with time-honored history and civilization, China abounds in intangiblecultural heritages. Cultural heritages connect modern people with the historical past, allowingthem to acquire a cultural and historical identity.

It is also pathetic to see elderlypeople in possession of such legacies pass away without transmitting them to the youngergeneration.
