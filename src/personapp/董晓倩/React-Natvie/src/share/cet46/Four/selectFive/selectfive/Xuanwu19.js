Another way TV and the movies affect people is that they give people either abroader view of the world or a distorted one, depending on what type of program they watch.Those who watch news and educational program can learn many new things while those whowatch primarily entertainment shows may come to believe that most people in the worldpossess great wealth and good looks. It may make them become dissatisfied with their ownlives. Finally, perhaps the most susceptible viewers are children, who may be unable to tell factfrom fiction and may try to imitate acts that they see on TV or in the movies.`}
